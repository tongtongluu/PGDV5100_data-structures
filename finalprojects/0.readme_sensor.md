### Part1: SENSOR DEMO<br/>
The information on my app about sensor include:  
1. A landing page, with references to the three projects and its raw data accordingly. 
Use leaf as the main theme, indicate that I am working on the structure of data. Very simple and clear that the background color is purely white.
I also made a version for mobile phone that the side bar will only appear when the screen is small enough.

2. A page that shows the Sensor dataï¼š link to the raw data.

### Part2: Project process:
1. collect all the data with query one, calculate the average temperature with query two
query one
```
async function allTem() {
    try{
       const result4 = await client_aa.query("SELECT * FROM sensorData");
        return  result4.rows;
    }
    catch(e){
        return (e);
    }
    
}

```
query two
```
var thirdQuery = `SELECT 
        EXTRACT(DAY FROM sensorData) as sensorday,
        EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sensorData) as sensorhour,
        AVG(sensorvalue::int) as AVGTEMP
        FROM sensorData
        GROUP BY sensorday,sensorhour
        ORDER BY sensorday
        ;`;
client_aa.query(secondQuery, (err, res) => {
    if (err) {throw err}
    else {
    //console.table(res.rows);

    var data = JSON.stringify(res.rows)
    
    res1.send(res.rows)
    }
});

```



3. Further dealing with the data  and make it loaded to the page that ready to draw
```
var allData = [];
var completeData = [];

function filterData(d) {
    for (var i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
    var day = d.filter(x => {
        if (x.sensorday == i + 1) {
            return x
        }
    })

    allData.push(day)
}

console.log(allData)



allData.forEach(day => {
    var dayObj = {};
    day.forEach(hour => {
        dayObj[hour.sensorhour] = hour.avgtemp
    })
    completeData.push(dayObj)
})

console.log(completeData)

}

```


3. assgin the different color into varieties of color ranges, mainly theme in green
```
   if (parseFloat(d.value) < 65) {
          return "#f1f9f5";
      }
      else if (parseInt(d.value) >= 65 && parseInt(d.value <67)) {
         return "#d4ede2";
      } 
      else if (parseFloat(d.value) >= 67 && parseFloat(d.value) <69) {
         return "#b7e1ce";
       } 
       else if (d.value >= 69 && d.value <71) {
         return "#9ad6bb"
       } 
       else if (d.value >= 71 && d.value <73) {
           return "#7dcaa7";
       } 
       else if (d.value >= 73 && d.value <75){
          return "#60b194"
       }
        else if (d.value >= 75 && d.value <77){
          return "#47ae80"
       }
        else if (d.value >= 77 && d.value <79){
          return "#3b916a"
       }
        else if (d.value >= 79 && d.value <81){
          return "#325740"
       }
        else if (d.value >= 81 ){
          return "#060e0b"
       }
       })
  .attr("stroke", "white")
  .style("stroke-width", "0.5px")
  .style("opacity", 0.7)

}
```


4. User Interface Design </br>
My design is different from the result here, i changed ideas of barcode into donuts. 
will explore more d3 libraries to see if i can further combine the data
The sketch is in [week11](https://github.com/tongtongluu/PGDV5100_data-structures/blob/master/Week11) folder <br/>
<br/>



### Part3: Some questions to answer:
#### 1. Information that user need<br/>
the viewers want to get a direct sense of how temperature changes. Therefore, i grouped the data into days, then each part of the pie represent the 
average temperature during that hour. the color only changes in shades of green. 
#### 2. relavent data:
data should be able to answer some basic quesitons: how.
I believe that users wanted to see the trend of changing, not the exact value of temperature
I do not change other divergent colors to make them distinct with each other
because I feel like the temperature did not change much and it should be matched up with the green them of my app.
#### 3. default view and general view:
as the pictures showed from the very begining of this documentation. 
For the donut view, I only choose the latest 30 days. For the line graph view, it keep adding the current temperature
#### 4. the defalut query:
The data can be cleaned from the front end, so the basic defalut query is just print out all the value inthe sensorData database.
Though i created new average query for the donut view, I am pretty sure the defalut query is also valid enough.



### Part4: Relections based on the assessment criterias:
#### the intergrity of data and database:
My sensor tracks the new data every 5 minute, i did experience internet failure during the past month. Luckily i still get enough data to get my back.
#### the efficiency of queires and page load
For the sensor part, one query that ask all the data in posgres is precise and right on opint.
I am so glad i did not track it through dynamodb. I have to use a scan function to query all the data, but it is only one "*" in posgres
I love the donut view, and I will work on that more.

#### Acknowledgement : Marisa, Coding Train on Youtube
I have got helps from Marisa, she kindly express the idea of the line view.
The current app is not that close to my desired design, will polish it during the break
