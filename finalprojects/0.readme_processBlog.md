### Part1: BLOG DEMO<br/>
Process blog
Theme of blog is reflections of four courses I â€˜ve taken this semester. 
Use nosql dynamo db for altogether 58 entries. Use course as my partition key and created time as my sort key. This query have one criteria, which is the partition key, so here I can click into different subjects. 
The information on my app about sensor include:  
1. A landing page, with references to the three projects and its raw data accordingly. 
Use leaf as the main theme, indicate that I am working on the structure of data. Very simple and clear that the background color is purely white.
I also made a version for mobile phone that the side bar will only appear when the screen is small enough.

### Part2: Project process:
1. collect all the data with the scan function
```
function onScan(err, data) {
            if (err) {
                console.error("Error. Error JSON:", JSON.stringify(err, null, 2));
            } else {
                data.Items.forEach(function(item) {
                    // console.log(item)
                    // console.log("***** ***** ***** ***** ***** \n", item);
                    output.blogpost.push({'course':item.course.S, 'content':item.keyInfo.SS, 'thoughts':item.thoughts.S,'created':moment(item.created.S).format("LL")});
                });
    
                fs.readFile('blogghandle.html', 'utf8', (error, data) => {
                    var template = handlebars.compile(data);
                    var html = template(output);
                    resolve(html);
                });
            }
        };

```
2. set up the queries that covers the requiments for partition key and sort key
```
if (course != 'all'){
            var params = {
                TableName : "newBlog",
                KeyConditionExpression: "course = :course and created between :minDate and :maxDate", // the query expression
                ExpressionAttributeValues: { // the query values
                    ":course": {S: course},
                    ":minDate": {S: new Date(minDate).toISOString()},
                    ":maxDate": {S: new Date(maxDate).toISOString()},
                }
            };
            
            client_dynamodb.query(params, onScan)

        } else {
            var params = {
                TableName: "newBlog",
                ProjectionExpression: "created, blogName, course, keyInfo, thoughts",
                FilterExpression: "created between :minDate and :maxDate",
                 ExpressionAttributeValues: { // the query values
                    ":minDate": {S: new Date(minDate).toISOString()},
                    ":maxDate": {S: new Date(maxDate).toISOString()}
                }

```



3. Further dealing with the data  and make it ready for the page
```
function getResults(){
    // creates an object to store our variable(s) in that will be sent back to the server.
    // $('select[name="category"]').val() is jQuery and gets the current selected value from the dropdown.
    var parameters = {course: $('select[name=course]').val(), week: $('select[ name = "week"]').val()};

    //this is AJAX and it calls the /blog endpoint on the server(in app.js) and sends the paramters object.
    $.get( '/blog',parameters, function(data) {
            console.log(data)
        // When the server returns information, the returned data (hanlebars html) is added to the blogpost DIV.
        // Alternatively, if the server is sending back JSON data, you can use it to create a map or graph etc.
        $('.blogposts').html(data)
    });
}
 getResults()
```


3. use bootstrape and handle bars to deal with each record and its styling
```
   <div class="card-body">
      <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
        <span class="border border-primary">
          <li class="list-group-item"><h5>KEY NOTES: {{content}}</h5></p></li>
          <li class="list-group-item"><h5>CREATED: {{created}}</h5></p></li> 
          <li class="list-group-item"><h5>THOUGHTS: {{thoughts}}</h5></p></li>
        </span>
      </ul>
    </div>
```


4. Old Versions </br>
As being show previously from the very begining of this md file. THe query for my old version include two criterias, one is the course the other is the week order. but every time it only popped up with one result. 
so I reduced the criterias into one that can minimizes opportunities for error. 
<br/>

5. Design </br>
my previous design is more abstract, very different from the current result
The sketch is in [week11](https://github.com/tongtongluu/PGDV5100_data-structures/blob/master/Week11) folder <br/>
<br/>

### Part3: Some questions to answer:
#### 1. Information that user need<br/>
Users need to sort different courses to see the whole process of learning for one single projects or more
#### 2. relavent data:
data should be able to answer some basic quesitons: which and what?
one thing for the defalut view is that i want it to be in chronological order, not based on the partition key
#### 3. default view :
I found out bootstrape is an efficient style library. and I want to incorporate pictures, not only texts
#### 4. the default query:
The default query is scaning through all the record i've got in this database, then the users can filter into different objects, but only one for each time.



### Part4: Relections based on the assessment criterias:
#### the intergrity of data and database:
The data itsef inthe database it rich in range, but not that rich in content. I just show the idea here, but the columms such as thoughts. what i have learned need to be put into details.
Again, add more pictures will be fantastic.
#### the efficiency of queires and page load
The query is simple, for the idea of realibility that this time I want the app running first, regardless of complicated user requirements
#### Acknowledgement : Marisa, Coding Train on Youtube
I have got helps from Salonie, she basic structures of dynamodb quries make it very easy to understand
The current app is not that close to my desired design, will polish it during the break
