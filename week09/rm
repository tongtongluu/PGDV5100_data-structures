# Weekly Assignment 9

### Due Monday, 11/4 at 6:00pm


## Setup and preparation

#### PART ONE

Decide to use postgreSQL , the data is somewhat well structured, with not many other kinds of formats.
Here I found the datatype is differeent, so I turn boolean into number.

**/setup.js**

```javascript 
// Sample SQL statement to create three tables, but this time only has the data of the address table: 每张表一定要有pk，这个sql确保了character文字形式也能作为primary key，否则的话要用数字
var thisQuery = "CREATE TABLE sensorData ( sensorValue real, sensorTime timestamp DEFAULT current_timestamp );";
// Sample SQL statement to delete a table: 
//var thisQuery = "DROP TABLE sensorData;"; 

```

#### PART TWO

at first the .env file did not work, I need to install dotenv again
const dotenv = require('dotenv').config();

#### PART THREE

the result looks like this:
