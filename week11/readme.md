## Assignment 

Part 1: visuals and the workflow:
•	Default view
landing page:
design ideas: 
Use leaf as the main theme, indicate that I am working on the structure of data. Very simple and clear that the background color is purely white.
I also made a version for mobile phone that the side bar will only appear when the screen is small enough.

sensor data
design ideas:
Use green as the main color. Besides the key points showing on page such as I collected xxx data, the highest and lowest temperature is yy and zz accordingly.
for the lower visual part. I made a barcode chart to visualize the average temperature for each hours of the day.

learning process diary
design ideas:
for the learning process blog. I was inspired by the visuals of github. The green got darker with the increasing of the number of contirtubions per day.
I use the same idea on that visual, too. 
The background is green in different shades, decided by the number of notes per week. And I use grey for data structures, purple for dvia and yellow for stats.
The x axis is the hour of each day. That the start of each color block is decided by the time I created the diary ontes. 
Therefore, some of the colors may condensed with each other for I may write notes for different class on the same hour of different days.

aa map
design ideas:
same with the leaf idea, the map also use dark black as the background. Therefore the colorful dots can have sharp contrasts. 
the sidebar will come from the right side of the screen, where the user can select certain meetings based on the criterias ranges from location to time.
There also contains a slide bar on bottom part of the page that users can zoom in to see the details more clearly.

•	Workflow
start from the landing page, users can click through three links on top of the page which links to three projects seperatly. Also, when the screen is small enough 
for example in a moble phone screen, a side bar will appear from the right side of the screen as the landing page for three projects.
The learning process diary is interactive that the user can choose to see blogs from certain week or speficif projects.
The sensor tacking one is purely static.
For the aa map, users can select zone(or zones), address, building name, meeting name, 
days, start from ,meeting type to filter certain meeting.

Part 2： preprocessing：
•	For the sensor tracking data: 
I need to calculate one average temperature for each day throughout the month.
•	For the mapping
 it require filtering of the data, aggregation them into a united json or a array and reconstrution of the information into the screen. 
Part3：Assumptions about the users
the users will need to search the information both on web and mobile phone. Also, the users will need to find specific meetings near their current locations.

Part 4: Thinking about realiability
based on the topic of our group, the realiability.
because this app is just in testing, so the fully realibility is not that important. I need to ensure the core functions works,that at least the user can 
get some data ,or information back to the screen.
